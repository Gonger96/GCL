GCL
===

GCL is a small GUI Library for Windows. It allows you to draw controls onto your window. At the moment it provides
two different engines (GDI+ and Direct2D), therefore it supports older and newer Windows versions. GCL makes it 
possible to create great layouted and modern applications with a small amount of code.

A compiler with C++11 support is required
